        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming.<br><br>My research interests include various topics in environmental economics, specifically as it pertains to the development of environmental policy. My dissertation, <strong>Human, Environmental, and Economic Interactions: Quantitative Studies and Empirical Support</strong>, includes studies investigating the value of wildlife recreation in Grand Teton National Park, the impact of mis- and disinformation of political support for climate change policy, and the alignment of current wildfire policy with public risk preferences.</p>

        <p>My CV is <a href="Peri Brimley CV.pdf">here</a>. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:pbrimley@uwyo.edu">pbrimley@uwyo.edu</a>.</p>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>
